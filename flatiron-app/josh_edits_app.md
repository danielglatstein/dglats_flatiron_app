Why are you applying to the Flatiron School? *

The Flatiron School is the perfect launching pad towards a profession that will be fulfilling to me. I have begun to learn to code on my own for the past few months. In this time I have learned that I love it because I have been presented with a brand new set challenges, have been inspired to be innovative and have been forced to think creatively. 

I admire Flatiron’s ability to teach coding as an art. Five years ago, the thought of learning to be a programmer never would have crossed my mind. I studied acting at NYU Tisch School of the Arts; we didn’t have ‘computer’ class; we had character analysis, movement and diction. There was constant reflection on what choices were successful and what didn’t work. These classes taught me the value of a ‘problem’. Problems teach me how things work, expand my imagination, and they force me to take a stand and confidently say, “here is my idea for how to fix this.” As an artist, you must enjoy creatively solving problems.  

I know any career I pursue will need to have the room for me to be creative. I will always approach whatever I do as an artist. This is what attracts me to programming.

I saw first hand how the Flatiron School helped my roommate, Josh Rowley; he grew as a friend and professional. I also saw how much dedication it took on his part. And I can see how he still hasn’t stopped learning new things since. After speaking with Josh, he warned me of programming’s struggles and obstacles, the need for resilience when learning, and the persistence to keep going.  I have watched him grow from an eager student into a polished professional. I decided to give it a go and started working on the Flatiron School’s pre-work. I dove right in, and have hardly come up for a breath since.

First, I took a course on how to build an HTML/CSS site from scratch. This gave me the impetus to design my own website, “dodgerredhead.nyc”, that would function as a blog where I could share cool things about myself with the world. As I built the website, it became apparent to me how programming really is a creative expression. Similar to acting, programming requires you to use your whole mind like a puzzle does, visualize large complex problems and break them down into smaller tasks.

I then moved onto the Git, GitHub, Ruby, and Rails sections in the Flatiron Pre-work. Having access to these resources helped to solidify my interest in programming. The ideas started popping up for how to improve my project. I pushed my initial commits up to GitHub, began to make it a web application, started to learn how to configure gems and I generated models and migrations. Each idea led to new things to learn and new problems to solve. I was hooked.

I challenged myself to study programming on my own and I have a passion to continue learning at the Flatiron School because I will be challenged creatively as a member of a thriving community. I witnessed first-hand what a powerful influence the program has had in my friends professional life and I am inspired to do the same. 



Tell us about your professional/educational career to date. What are you up to now and how did you end up there? *
I grew up in Pasadena, CA and moved to New York City in 2006 to attend NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts. I graduated in 2010 with a BFA in Acting and a minor in African studies. 

I studied in the Meisner Extension, part of NYU Tisch’s rigorous studio program. The ideology centers around one principle: to build your character through detail by asking questions and trying to be as specific as possible. Break down every aspect of the problem at hand and find out as much as you can about it.

After graduating from NYU, I have always been looking for ways to be creative. I have been lucky enough to be a part of some fulfilling, amazing projects. 

My volunteer work with the NGO Zara Aina (which translates in English to “Share Life”) took me to Madagascar for six weeks as part of a team that developed and led theater programming intended to engage at-risk Malagasy children. The children selected to be a part of the program were aged 10-14 years old and are prone to abject poverty, abuse and homelessness. My work with Zara Aina helps to motivate these children to achieve more and invest in their sense of possibility. Since Zara Aina’s inception in 2012, I have worn many hats and have shown some serious hustle while volunteering to take on some unique challenges: applying for 501C3 tax exemptions, meeting with UNICEF officials at the Malagasy embassy in New York to solicit funding, and arranging the silent auction for our Benefit Show where we raised over 75,000 dollars. 

As the nanny of two 10 year olds in Brooklyn, I found the delicate balance of being a playmate and a role model. I could be silly and play games, but also inspire the kids to dream up awesome projects like woodcarving, building a Go-Kart from scratch, or remodeling a road bike. 

And using what I had learned about art, farming and carpentry from my experiences in Africa, I transformed the backyard of my Crown Heights brownstone into an urban-garden. Digging up the Kudzu-infested soil and filling it with a slew of heirloom tomatoes, tomatillos, and mammoth sunflowers; scouring the streets of Brooklyn for the perfect wooden pallets to recycle into a table, bench and vertical planters full of lush greens. 

In the fall of 2014, I started working for a grocery delivery tech start up, Good Eggs, as a member of their operations team. I was attracted to the company because of their mission to build and sustain local food systems. I began studying the code that Good Egg’s systems relied on and this sparked my interest in being a web developer. I realized I wanted to be a part of a team that built applications like the ones the operations team ran on. In February of 2015 Good Eggs underwent a restructure that resulted in the company laying off 20% of the wok force in one day. I was among those who lost their jobs that day. After initially feeling disappointment, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as I have now been able to dedicate more of my time to programming. All of these unique experiences have led me to a place where I am ready to use my adaptability, creativity and problem-solving skills in an innovative and challenging environment like the Flatiron School. 

The ability to think in a structured way, both creatively and quantitatively, to solve complex problems is an important element of being a successful developer. Can you tell us anything that demonstrates your abilities in that realm? (anything from standardized test scores to experience playing a musical instrument counts) *

In 2014, I traveled to Madagascar as a volunteer teacher with Zara Aina. The theater programming I helped to create inspired our students to be confident learners who are better prepared to participate actively in their education, community and social lives. Through  thinking creatively and collaborating with others, theater helps to motivate the students to achieve more and invest in their sense of possibility. 

Zara Aina’s 2014 program began with the 30 students choosing a Malagasy folktale to turn into a play. At the end of the rehearsal process there would be three shows, highlighted by a performance in front of over 5,000 people at UNICEF’S “30 Years in Madagascar” celebration. 

My work with one of the students, Andreas, demonstrates how I was able to turn a complex problem into a learning experience. A short time into the program, I noticed that Andreas was having a great deal of difficulty fitting in.  He was shy on stage and he would always get in fights with the other kids off-stage to distract from rehearsal. 

It turned out the other students were teasing Andreas because his mother was a drug addict. While all of the students who participate in Zara Aina needed tons of love and care, I realized that Andreas required extra compassion and patience. 

It was a difficult conversation to have, but I knew I had to find a way to encourage Andreas to be more involved in Zara Aina’s programming. The success of the workshop hinged on the ability of the instructors to build a trust between Andreas and themselves. I took Andreas aside and let him know that he was one of the bravest actors I had ever seen. 

After sticking up for Andreas, his attitude seemed to transform. He started coming by the house in the mornings before rehearsal to play dominos and cards. He was much more expressive and involved in rehearsals. His relationship with his friends improved and he hardly got into physical confrontations anymore, which greatly improved everyone else’s productivity in rehearsals. 

One night, while cleaning up the house after rehearsal we noticed that two of our Ipods had gone missing. After turning the house upside down, we realized that one of the students had probably taken them. 

The next day at rehearsal we called the ensemble together and let them know the situation, “no one can come over to the house until the electronics are returned.” 

The students went into an uproar. They hated the idea of not being able to come over to hang out. They all started to point their fingers, “ANDREAS!” 

It hurt to think Andreas could have done it and my first reaction was to punish him.  None of the students had ever taken anything from the house before, but it seemed that the temptation had proven to be too much. It would have been easy to give up on Andreas and see him as just a thief. After all, most of his friends had already dropped out of school to steal or beg, why would Andreas be different? 

But, I thought about the forgiveness my parents and teachers had shown me when I had done something wrong as a child. Why should Andreas’ ethnicity, class, or nationality decide that he couldn’t have the benefit of the doubt like I did? 

There didn’t seem to be a clear solution to this problem, but I knew I had to turn it into a learning moment that could help the student grow. I took Andreas aside and said, “I understand people make mistakes. I used to get into a lot of trouble at school. All I care about is that you bring the best version of yourself to rehearsal tomorrow.” 

The next morning Andreas returned the Ipods.  

This is an example of the trust that Zara Aina’s work helps to build between the instructors and the students. This trust helps to make Zara Aina a transformational program.  

For the rest of the workshop, Andreas was a model student. He became the star of his scene and would come to rehearsals with lots of ideas. 

Andreas had a smile on his face that stretched from ear to ear after he performed at UNICEF’S “30 Years in Madagascar” celebration. Andreas expressed to me that in the beginning he felt small and as if he had nothing to offer, but as a result of the time spent working with the company he felt “big” and recognized the gifts that he possesses. 

Working to organize a multi-national, educational-theater NGO is an extremely complicated process that required a kick-ass team to show some serious hustle. Ultimately, it was each team member’s ability to break down a huge puzzle into smaller tasks that allowed me to be a positive influence on a kid like Andreas. My experience working to inspire Malagasy students has prepared me to not be intimidated by any problem. I have learned to adapt to any environment, finding way to be successful when even the most complicated challenges arise. I believe that I can bring unique experiences as well as a proven skill set to the Flatiron School.
